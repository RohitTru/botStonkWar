# Models

This folder contains SQLAlchemy models representing the core database tables for the StockBot brokerage handler.

- `user.py`: User accounts and balances
- `position.py`: User stock positions and holdings
- `trade.py`: Trade recommendations, notifications, and executions
- `portfolio.py`: Historical snapshots and brokerage-wide metrics

Add new models here as needed for additional features.
